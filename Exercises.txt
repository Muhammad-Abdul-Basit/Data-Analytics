Query sakila data with MySQL

Analyze with Python (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)

Visualize insights (and later push them to Tableau).

Here are some starter questions for data analytics practice:

🔍 Basic Data Extraction

How many films are in the film table?

List the top 10 films with the longest rental duration.

Get the total number of customers.

Find the number of rentals each store has.

📊 Basic Analysis in Python

Which categories of movies (e.g., Action, Comedy) are most common?

What’s the average rental rate of films in each category?

Which actors appear in the most films?

Which customers have rented the most films?

📈 Visualization Ideas for Tableau

Plot rentals per month for the year 2006.

Show top 5 most rented movies.

Create a pie chart of film categories by number of films.

Build a bar chart of revenue per store.

Would you like me to give you the exact SQL queries for these first, or walk you through the Python workflow (MySQL → Pandas → Visualization) step by step? 🎨
